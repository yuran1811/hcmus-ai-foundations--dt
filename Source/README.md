# Project 4: Linear Models

## Step 1: Installation

- We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as package manager, so make sure you have installed it or just have python interpreter

- Download dependencies
  - using uv
  ```bash
  uv sync
  ```
  - without using uv
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Step 2: Running the project

- If you use `Jupyter Notebook` with `VSCode`, make sure the notebook use the python executor from `.venv` from step 1.
- Open the `./src/main.ipynb` (including the output generated from the last running) or `./src/main.mini.ipynb` (not including output) and run the notebook topdown sequentially.
- The models generated from the running process will automatically saved in `./models`
